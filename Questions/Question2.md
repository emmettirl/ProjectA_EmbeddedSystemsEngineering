**See vid.c for the code that was used to complete this exercise.**

_Simple editor program for the emulated versatilepb board. You may use the supplied sample code in your editor._

_The supplied code is not optimised to aid usability e.g. it re-displays the whole editor window on a key press._

_You will need to implement at least the following in your editor :_
- a). _left, right and down arrow keys (up arrow is ‘done’). You can determine the appropriate escape sequence by using the 2.6 example and printing out the key stroke values._
- 
- b). _backspace and delete._
- c). _delete a line e.g. ctrl -d._
- d) _insert mode – currently key strokes overwrite the previous character. Need to avoid pushing characters over the edge of the screen._
- e). _copy a line and insert the line in a new location_
